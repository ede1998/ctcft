## Agenda

As they are prepared, you will be able to find the [presentations on hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@rust-ctcft?tags=%5B%222021-07-19%22%5D), or linked below.

- Opening remarks (nikomatsakis)
- [Mentoring](https://hackmd.io/@rust-ctcft/BywLCHqpd#/) ([doc-jones])
  - The Rust project has a number of mechanisms for getting people involved in the project, but most are oriented around 1:1 engagement. Doc has been investigating some of the ways that other projects engage contributors, such as Python's [mentored sprints](https://www.mentored-sprints.dev/). She will discuss how some of those projects run things and share some ideas about how that might be applied in the Rust project.
- [Lang team initiative process](https://hackmd.io/@rust-ctcft/H1ZV1U5pd#/) ([joshtriplett])
  - The lang team recently established a new process we call _initiatives_. This is a refinement of the RFC process to include more explicit staging. Josh will talk about the new process, what motivated it, and how we're trying to build more sustainable processes.
- [Driving discussions via postmortem analysis](https://hackmd.io/@rust-ctcft/SJOd3Sqad#/) ([pnkfelix])
  - Innovation means taking risks, and risky behavior sometimes leads to process failures. An example of a recent process failure was the Rust 1.52.0 release, and subsequent [1.52.1 patch release][] that followed a few days later. Every failure presents an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and correct our processes going forward. In response to the 1.52.0 event, the compiler team recently went through a ["course correction" postmortem process][fingerprint coe] inspired by the "Correction of Error" reviews that pnkfelix has observed at Amazon. This talk describes the structure of a formal postmortem, and discusses how other Rust teams might deploy similar postmortem activities for themselves.
- Open floor
  - Open time for comments or questions.

## Social hour

Like last time, we are going to try an experimenatal social hour after the CTCFT. The idea is really simple: for the hour after the meeting, we will create breakout rooms in Zoom with different themes. You can join any breakout room you like and hangout.

The themes for the breakout rooms will be based on suggestions. If you have an idea for a room you'd like to try, you can post it in a [dedicated topic on the #ctcft Zulip stream](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/286036-ctcft/topic/social.20hour.202021-06-21). Or, if you see somebody else has posted an idea that you like, then add a üëç emoji. We'll create the final breakout list based on what we see there. The breakout rooms can be as casual or focused as you like. You might, for example, talk about your favorite crates, or we might continue some of the discussions from the meeting.
